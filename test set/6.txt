Man United midfielder Ander Herrera was hit with a new setback last night after it emerged La Liga prosecutors want him jailed for FOUR years over an alleged match-fixing scandal should he be found guilty.

Spanish state prosecutors said they were demanding a two-year prison sentence and six-year soccer ban for the midfielder, who has denied any wrongdoing, and 35 other footballers in an indictment lodged with a court in Valencia earlier this month.


Two-year prison sentences for first-time offenders in Spain are normally suspended, meaning that if Herrera was convicted of sports corruption he would probably escape jail.

But on Monday it emerged lawyers for Spain’s top league, who have also launched legal action against the footballers involved in the under-suspicion May 2011 match between Herrera’s old side Zaragoza and Levante, were demanding stiffer penalties than the state lawyers if they are found guilty of sports corruption.
