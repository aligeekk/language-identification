This weapon is particularly effective for targeting multiple enemies or if the player is not very accurate, since it has the ammo capacity and rate-of-fire to sweep the area at close to mid-range. However, aiming for targets at long range becomes ineffective, as the bullet scatter radius makes shot placement very inaccurate.
This weapon can deal slightly less damage than a Pistol, so use the Machine gun against groups of low level enemies. This is less effective late in the game as even the weakest enemies require multiple hits to kill.
If the player is willing to deal with repetitive motion, the recoil reduction upgrade can be achieved manually. Repeatedly tapping the trigger, proving it is done slowly enough, can reduce the recoil to zero, it does however increase the amount of time needed to spend one’s ammo clip, by 40% (from approximately 5 to 7 seconds), decreasing damage per second. A middle ground can be achieved by balancing damage per second to the player’s desire by increasing the frequency of trigger pulls.
When the player has acquired enough Antipersonnel Auto Rounds, it is recommended to keep it as the main ammunition for the Machine Gun, except if the player wishes to use it against Security Devices or Big Daddies. Later in the game (and particularly on harder difficulty settings), regular machine gun rounds can prove ineffectual against the tougher enemies.
